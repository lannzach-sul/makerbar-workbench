# Terman Library's Intro to Autodesk Fusion #
Welcome to the online version of the Terman Engineering Library's Autodesk Fusion workshop. Previously we offered this workshop in-person in the Winter 2025 quarter. We plan to offer this and other workshops in the coming months; please check the [MakerBar Homepage](https://guides.library.stanford.edu/makerbar) for upcoming sessions.
